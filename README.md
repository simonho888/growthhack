# Growth Journal

A mobile app that helps you learn and grow from negative experiences by following a structured reflection process.

## Concept

This app is based on a powerful growth exercise:

1. **Record negative experiences** - Document challenging situations when they occur
2. **Reflect after one week** - Add what you learned from the experience
3. **Reflect after one month** - Identify what benefits came from the experience

By following this process, you can transform negative experiences into valuable growth opportunities, developing resilience and wisdom over time.

## Features

- **Record negative experiences** with a simple, intuitive interface
- **Timed reflection prompts** that appear at appropriate intervals
- **Track your growth journey** through a comprehensive history view
- **Review insights** from past experiences to reinforce learning

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
